I am still struggling to figure out the best way to define the language and meta in the system. here are some concerns:

- does the graph need to know what language it is being created for? I don't think so. but what if we want to filter some nodes per language?
    - yes: how we are going to define it and more importantly how we are going to change it to export the graph for another engine?
	- no: how we are going to define shader meta like render_mode in Godot or lightmode tags in Unity?
- Do we really need to compile a shader with different vert/frag/light configs? or it is better to have everything in one graph with different output nodes?,
- We can add some custom nodes within the graph to define shader meta per language. one node per language or in graph properties, define an array of different language targets and different metas.

----

Graphs does not need to know about the target language.
We do not need to filter any nodes even for compute shaders.

----

Surface shader
Canvas shader
FullScreen shader
Fog shader
These are shader types
And each one of them can or can not have vertex or fragment shader stages.

In Unity, Surface shader has struct Vertex and Fragment:

Different types of graphs


surface
screen
compute


----
Roadmap: (easier to implement)
- canvas
	- color vec4
- surface
	- complex -> PBR
- compute
	- data management(?) -> handling different buffers (textures, structs)


---

having different graphs for vertex and fragment to decouple nodes for each shader stage. helps us separate  node validations to prevent from connecting the same node to vert and frag.
