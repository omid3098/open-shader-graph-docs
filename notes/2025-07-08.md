Node path from system should be supported
Output nodes does not have value. they only have names to be found and types to be checked when connecting to other pins. their values will be replaced by the node template itself. so even if we have a node with multiple outputs, output pin names should be presented in the language template.
We also do not generate code for each node. we generate code for pins of that node if they are connected and we reached to them while iterating the whole graph from output nodes.
