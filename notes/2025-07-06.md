Everything is nodes and connections.
A graph is a composition node
A math node is a primitive node

Node structure:
```yaml
id: -1
type: "" 
title: ""
meta: []
position: [0,0]
nodes: []
inputs:
 - name: ""
   type: ""
   value: "" 
outputs: 
 - name: ""
   type: ""
   value: ""
```
- Node type can be like 
- if nodes array is empty, then the node is a primitive node, else it is a composition node.

Pin structure:
``` yaml
name: ""
type: ""
value: ""
```
- Pin values can be a path as string to point to an internal node within the graph or an external node resource for connected pins or actual value for not connected pins
- Pin types should be primitive types like float, vec2, bool, etc..
Todo: we need a property to prevent a node from deletion. like for vertex pass and fragment pass nodes within a surface shader graph.
