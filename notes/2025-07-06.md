Everything is nodes and connections.
A graph is a composition node
A math node is a primitive node

Node structure:
```yaml
id: -1
type: "" 
title: ""
position: [0,0]
nodes: []
inputs:
 - type: ""
   value: "" 
outputs: 
 - type: ""
   value: ""
```
- Input/Output values can be a path as string to point to an internal node within the graph or an external node resource for connected pins or actual value for not connected pins
- Node type is Primitive node or composition node
