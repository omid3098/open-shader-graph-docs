Everything is nodes and connections.
A graph is a composition node
A math node is a primitive node

Node structure:
```yaml
id: -1
type: "" # primitive node or composition node
title: ""
position: [0,0]
inputs:
	- type: ""
	  value: "" #value can be a path as string for connected pins or actual value
outputs: 
	- type: ""
	  value: ""
```
