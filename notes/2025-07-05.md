   1. Composition via Nodes: A graph can contain "primitive" nodes (like Add, Multiply) and "composition" nodes (which are themselves other graphs). This is the fundamental principle of nesting.
   2. Referencing vs. Embedding:
       * Internal (Embedded): A sub-graph can be defined directly inside the parent graph's YAML. This is useful for unique, one-off nested graphs that aren't meant to be reused.
       * External (Referencing): A sub-graph node can simply point to an external .yml file. We can build a library of common functions (e.g. Panner.yml, NormalFromHeightmap.yml) and reference them across many shaders.
   3. Interface Definition (Inputs & Outputs): For a graph to be used as a node, it needs a clear "interface" â€“ a set of input and output pins. We can define these with special node types within
      the sub-graph's definition, like core/Input and core/Output.
   4. Layering via Overrides: When you reference an external graph, you might want to change some of its default values without editing the original file. The YAML should support a mechanism for
      applying these non-destructive overrides.
