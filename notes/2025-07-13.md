Updates:
No more node[] inside a node. 
yaml graph structure will be stored flat.
connections will be stored in output pins like ref:127/out and the 127 is a node within the main graph as every other node.
we will have a global unique id generator that handles node ids based on the latest added node to the graph.
if a subgraph is added to the graph its own id and all internal node ids and pin values will be updated accordingly.

## This decision was made only for performance reason and reducing the traverse complexity
